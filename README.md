# Productivity Prediction of Garment Employees

## Project Information
This project focuses on analyzing and predicting the productivity of garment employees using data mining techniques. The dataset contains detailed information about employees, their working conditions, and their productivity levels in a garment manufacturing environment. The project applies both classification and clustering techniques to better understand productivity behavior and identify patterns among employees.

## Problem Statement
Employee productivity plays a crucial role in the efficiency and success of manufacturing industries. However, productivity levels may vary due to multiple factors such as work conditions, workload, and operational processes. The main problem addressed in this project is identifying the factors that influence employee productivity and determining whether productivity levels can be predicted accurately using data mining techniques. Additionally, the project aims to discover hidden patterns and similarities among employees based on their productivity data.

## Objectives
The objectives of this project are:
- To apply classification techniques to predict the productivity levels of garment employees.
- To apply clustering techniques to group employees with similar productivity characteristics.
- To analyze the dataset and understand the key attributes that affect employee productivity.
- To gain meaningful insights that could support decision-making in productivity management.

## Motivation
This dataset was chosen because productivity analysis is a critical aspect of workforce management in industrial environments. Understanding productivity patterns can help organizations improve efficiency, optimize resource allocation, and enhance overall performance. Moreover, the dataset is real-world, sufficiently large, and suitable for applying multiple data mining techniques covered in this course, making it an ideal choice for this project.
