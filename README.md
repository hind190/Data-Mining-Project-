# Productivity Prediction of Garment Employees

## Project Description
This project focuses on analyzing and predicting the productivity of garment employees using data mining techniques. The dataset contains information about workers’ performance, working conditions, and productivity levels. The main problem addressed in this project is understanding the factors that affect employee productivity and classifying productivity levels, as well as discovering patterns among workers with similar characteristics.

This project includes both classification and clustering tasks.

## Project Goal
The goal of this project is to:

Apply classification techniques to predict employee productivity levels based on different features.

Apply clustering techniques to identify groups of employees with similar productivity patterns and working conditions.

Through this, the project aims to gain insights into productivity behavior in the garment industry.

## Motivation
This dataset was chosen because employee productivity is an important factor in industrial performance and management. Understanding productivity patterns can help organizations improve efficiency, optimize working conditions, and support better decision-making. In addition, the dataset is real-world, well-structured, and suitable for applying multiple data mining techniques learned in this course.
