This technique was chosen after exploratory data analysis (EDA) revealed anomalies in over_time and targeted_productivity attributes. For instance, one record showed an over_time value of 25,000 minutes, which is unrealistic even when distributed across all 54 team members, and certain entries in targeted_productivity were below 0.1, which is implausibly low and likely due to data entry errors. To maintain accuracy, these records were removed by keeping only entries where over_time ≤ 25000 and targeted_productivity ≥ 0.1.\n",

The lowest targeted_productivity value became 0.35, which is a realistic and achievable productivity level in factory conditions. Similarly, the lowest over_time value now stands at 15,000 minutes, equivalent to about 250 hours, which is a plausible cumulative overtime duration for a full team of 30 employees. This process reduced data distortion, enhanced reliability, and ensured that the dataset now represents realistic target production behavior, leading to more accurate insights and reliable modeling outcomes."

These algorithms tend to perform better when target variables are discrete, as it allows for clear and interpretable rule-based outputs. The process divided actual_productivity into three categories: Low, Medium, and High, using the pd.cut() function with equal-width binning. This ensured that the full range of productivity values was captured while maintaining simplicity and interpretability, which are important for better understanding the model’s outcomes.\n",

This transformation made the target variable more suitable for Decision Tree classification, as the model could now work with clearly defined classes instead of continuous values. Additionally, the categorization enhanced interpretability by allowing a direct comparison across productivity levels and minimized the impact of small fluctuations in continuous measurements. This made the dataset more reliable and easier to model."
